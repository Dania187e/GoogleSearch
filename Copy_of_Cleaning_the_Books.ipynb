Fortunately, this process is continuing, \\nand new technology is emerging every year. Minimal invasive surgery has not \\nonly changed surgical techniques and procedures, but the entire surgical man-\\nagement of patients and hospitals. Interventional endoscopy has done the \\nsame thing. Thus, innovative endoscopic and surgical techniques are both \\nbeing nourished by new technology and may benefit from unconventional \\nnew ideas, which need to be explored and driven to thorough evaluations. \\nToday, in a few institutions around the world, surgeons, gastroenterologists, \\nengineers, and computer scientists work together and exchange their ideas to \\nfind synergisms and areas in which collaboration may be fruitful for future \\nconcepts to further minimize the trauma of therapy for the benefit of patients.\\nWe, at the Center for the Future of Surgery at the University of California \\nSan Diego, have focused on these subjects in our institution, as we are excited \\nabout new endoscopic and surgical techniques and keen to explore and test \\nnew innovative technologies. We are happy to gather authors and scientists \\nfrom around the world with their specific focus and specialties to create this \\nmanual in order to provide an overview and insight in some of the innovative \\nideas around gastro-intestinal surgery and endoscopy to stimulate further \\nactivities.\\nWe want to thank the authors and co-authors for their excellent contribu-\\ntions to make this manual possible. We also want to express our gratitude to \\nall involved at Springer publishing company for their help and professional-\\nism through the publishing process.\\nLa Jolla, CA, USA Santiago\\xa0Horgan\\nLa Jolla, CA, USA Karl-Hermann\\xa0Fuchs \\nv\\nContents\\n 1  Overview of Current Robotic Technology  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .   1\\nAlice Race and Santiago Horgan\\n 2  Challenges in Robotic and Minimally Invasive  \\nPancreatic Surgery in the Year 2020 . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  19\\nFlorian Gebauer, Christiane J.

The colonoscope uses 16 equally-sized elec-\\ntromechanically-controlled segments, each manip-\\nulated by an actuation controller to maneuver \\nthrough the colon.
